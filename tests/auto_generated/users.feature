### karate-config.js Updates

To support the provided OpenAPI specification, the following test data variables should be added to the existing `karate-config.js`:

```javascript
// Add these to your existing config object
testData: {
  validUserName: 'John Doe',
  validUserId: 1,
  validApplicationId: 1,
  baseUrl: 'https://example.com/api'
}
```

### Feature Files

Based on the OpenAPI specification, the following feature files will be created:

#### users.feature

```gherkin
Feature: User Management

Background:
  * url testData.baseUrl
  * configure headers = { Content-Type: 'application/json' }

Scenario: Get list of users
  Given path 'users'
  When method get
  Then status 200
  And match response == '#[]'

Scenario: Create a new user
  Given path 'users'
  And request { name: testData.validUserName }
  When method post
  Then status 201
  And match response == { id: '#number', name: '#string' }

Scenario: Get user by ID
  Given path 'users/' + testData.validUserId
  When method get
  Then status 200
  And match response == { id: '#number', name: '#string' }

Scenario: Get user by ID with invalid ID
  Given path 'users/invalid-id'
  When method get
  Then status 404

Scenario Outline: Create a new user with different names
  Given path 'users'
  And request { name: '<name>' }
  When method post
  Then status 201
  And match response == { id: '#number', name: '<name>' }

  Examples:
    | name      |
    | John Doe  |
    | Jane Doe  |
    | Test User |

Scenario: Get user by application ID
  Given path 'users/' + testData.validUserId + '/' + testData.validApplicationId
  When method get
  Then status 200
  And match response == { id: '#number', name: '#string' }
```

#### error-handling.feature

```gherkin
Feature: Error Handling

Background:
  * url testData.baseUrl
  * configure headers = { Content-Type: 'application/json' }

Scenario: Get user by ID with invalid ID
  Given path 'users/invalid-id'
  When method get
  Then status 404

Scenario: Create a new user with invalid request body
  Given path 'users'
  And request { invalid: 'data' }
  When method post
  Then status 400

Scenario: Get user by application ID with invalid application ID
  Given path 'users/' + testData.validUserId + '/invalid-id'
  When method get
  Then status 404
```

### Test Coverage

The provided feature files cover the following test scenarios:

* Happy path tests:
	+ Get list of users
	+ Create a new user
	+ Get user by ID
	+ Get user by application ID
* Negative test cases:
	+ Get user by ID with invalid ID
	+ Create a new user with invalid request body
	+ Get user by application ID with invalid application ID
* Data-driven tests:
	+ Create a new user with different names

### Validation Patterns

The provided feature files use the following validation patterns:

* Response validation:
	+ Status code validation (e.g., `Then status 200`)
	+ Response schema validation (e.g., `And match response == { id: '#number', name: '#string' }`)
* Schema validation:
	+ Exact matching for critical fields (e.g., `id` and `name`)
	+ Type matching for flexible validation (e.g., `#number` and `#string`)

### Error Handling

The provided feature files test the following error scenarios:

* Get user by ID with invalid ID
* Create a new user with invalid request body
* Get user by application ID with invalid application ID

### Advanced Features

The provided feature files do not use any advanced features such as authentication, file uploads, or dynamic data generation. However, these features can be added as needed to support the API under test.

### Organization Guidelines

The provided feature files follow the following organization guidelines:

* File naming: Descriptive names (e.g., `users.feature` and `error-handling.feature`)
* Scenario naming: Descriptive names (e.g., "Get list of users" and "Create a new user")
* Comments: Comments are added to explain complex validations and business logic

Note that the provided feature files are just a starting point, and you may need to add or modify scenarios to fully cover the API under test. Additionally, you may need to update the `karate-config.js` file to include any necessary configuration settings or test data variables.
